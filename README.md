# RISCV-Pipeline-Processor
This repository contains the project report for a RISC-V pipelined processor implementation. The report details the processorâ€™s five pipeline stages (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-Back), datapath structure, instruction formats, ALU control lines, sample instruction memory code, hazard handling techniques, and waveform results. It summarizes the design and operation of a modular, efficient RISC-V pipelined processor architecture.
